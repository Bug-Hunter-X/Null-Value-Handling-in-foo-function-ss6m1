# Bug Report: Null Value Handling in foo function

This repository contains a bug report and solution for a JavaScript function that does not handle null values correctly. The `foo` function is expected to perform some operations on the input values `a` and `b`. However, when null values are passed, the function does not handle them appropriately and may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy implementation of the function, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that gracefully handles null values. The problem lies in the function's failure to explicitly check for null values before attempting operations on them.

## Steps to Reproduce

1.  Clone the repository
2.  Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js`
3.  Observe the difference in null handling between the two versions
4.  Test both implementations with null values and compare the outcomes

## Solution

The solution involves explicitly checking for null values using the strict equality operator (`===`) and providing appropriate handling, such as returning a default value or throwing an error, depending on the intended behavior.
